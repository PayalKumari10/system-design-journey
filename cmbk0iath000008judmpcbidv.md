## 💠Functional Requirements (Real-life Example Style)

Let’s say you’re chilling with your headphones on and using Spotify. What all can you do? 🎧

Here's what we expect:

* ▶️ **Play/Pause Songs**
    
    * (Imagine tapping the play button on "Kesariya" and later pausing it when someone calls you)
        
* 📁 **Create and Manage Playlists**
    
    * (Like making a "Morning Motivation" playlist and adding 10 songs to it)
        
    * Play it **sequentially**, in **shuffle mode**, or your **custom order**.
        
* 🔊 **Support Multiple Output Devices**
    
    * Play music on:
        
        * Bluetooth speakers 📻
            
        * Wired headphones 🎧
            
        * Smart speakers 🗣️
            
        * Car stereo via AUX 🚗
            

(Hindi: Aap Spotify se music kahin bhi aur kisi bhi device par chala sakte ho, chahe woh Bluetooth ho ya wired speaker!)

## 💠 Non-Functional Requirements (Simple Language with Emoji Twist)

These are more about **how well** your app performs, not what it does.

* **Scalability**
    
    * Imagine crores of users streaming songs at the same time.
        
    * Your app must handle huge traffic, like Diwali ke time sabhi party songs sun rahe ho!
        
* **Extensibility**
    
    * Tomorrow you want to add support for playing music on smart glasses or via gestures — you should be able to do that without breaking the current system.
        

## 💠How to Think Like a System Designer?

### Let’s simplify Spotify into subsystems — like how you build a LEGO model one block at a time

#### 🔗 Components You Might Need:

1. **User Service** – for sign up/login
    
2. **Music Service** – to store and fetch songs
    
3. **Playlist Service** – to manage user playlists
    
4. **Streaming Service** – to deliver songs in real time
    
5. **Device Manager** – to route audio to the selected output device
    

## 💠Real-Life Analogy: Restaurant

<mark>Spotify</mark> is like a restaurant:

* You (User) place the order (Choose song/playlist)
    
* Kitchen (Backend Services) prepares the dish (Stream the song)
    
* Waiter (Streaming Service) brings it hot to your table (device)
    
* You can eat (listen) from a plate, bowl, or takeaway (multiple devices)
    

(Hindi: Jaise restaurant mein aap order karte ho aur waiter aapke table pe khana serve karta hai — Spotify bhi waise hi backend se song lekar aapke device par play karta hai)

## 💠System Design Concepts to Use

* **Microservices Architecture** (Each feature in its own module)
    
* **Load Balancer** to handle many users
    
* **CDN** to deliver music fast
    
* **Database** (SQL for user data, NoSQL for playlists/songs)
    

### 💠Custom Play Order Feature (Smart Design Idea)

If a user wants to:

* Play in **loop** 🔁
    
* Play **randomly** 🔀
    
* Play specific song on mood (custom logic) 💃
    

...You need a smart **Queue System** that takes user inputs and reshuffles tracks accordingly.

### 💠Recap (English + Hinglish Style)

**Spotify jaisa app banana mushkil nahi, agar design sahi ho!**

Functional Requirements:

> Gaana suno, playlist banao, aur kisi bhi device pe chalao.

Non-Functional:

> App scalable aur future-ready ho.

Use microservices, CDN, smart queueing, and modular device support to make it a reality.
