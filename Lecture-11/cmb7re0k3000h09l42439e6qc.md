**Hello developers, learners, and curious minds!**  
Welcome back to the **#8WeeksLLDChallenge** series. In **Week 3**, we’re taking a delicious dive 🍱 into designing a **Zomato-like food delivery app** — but ours is lovingly called **Tomato!** 😋

If you’ve ever ordered food online, this blog will hit differently — because this time, **you’re the architect** of the entire food delivery system.

## 💠 Functional Requirements — What Features Do We Need?

Let’s first break down the features that any food delivery app *must* have. Think like an interviewer sitting across the table asking:

> 💭 "Design a food delivery app — like Zomato or Swiggy."

Here's what we aim to support in our system:

### 1\. Users can search for restaurants based on location

(Hindi: "User apne location ke hisaab se restaurants dekh sakta hai")

➡️ Imagine you're hungry at college hostel — open the app, and boom, nearby food joints show up.

### 2\. Add food items to the cart

(Hindi: "User apne pasand ke khaane cart mein daal sakta hai")

➡️ Like adding **Paneer Butter Masala** and **Butter Naan** to your cart — that easy!

### 3\. Checkout and Payment Flow

(Hindi: "User cart se checkout karke online payment kar sakta hai")

➡️ Use UPI, Card, or Wallet — Tomato app supports it all

### 4\. Notification on Order Placement

(Hindi: "Order successful hone par user ko notify kiya jaata hai")

➡️ Just like Zomato says: **"Your food is being prepared"** — Tomato will tell you too

## 💠 Non-Functional Requirements — Let’s Make It Scalable & Modifiable

### 1\. Scalability:

> Can our app serve 1000 users a second across India?  
> Yes, if designed well!

2. ### Modifiability:
    

> Tomorrow if we want to add “Scheduled Orders” or “COD” (Cash on Delivery), can we do it easily?  
> Yes, with a modular & pattern-based design.

## 💠Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Approach

### 📍 Bottom-Up (Our Primary Approach):

We **start small** — design classes like `Restaurant`, `Cart`, `Order`, then connect them.  
(Hindi: "Pehle chhoti chhoti cheezen banao, fir unko jodo")

➡️ Like Lego blocks — one by one, build your system.

### 📍 Top-Down (Sometimes Helpful):

We **start big** — think of major features first, then break them down into smaller classes.

➡️ Best for planning before coding

## 💠 Let’s Talk Design Patterns 🍕

We’re not just writing code; we’re **architecting smart systems** using design patterns! Here’s what we used in Tomato:

### 📍 Singleton Design Pattern

> "Ensure only one instance of a class exists."  
> (Hindi: "Sirf ek object ban sake aur sab log use hi use karein")

🔄 Used for:  
✅ Order Manager  
✅ Restaurant Tracker

### 📍 Factory Pattern for Order Creation

> Create different types of orders without changing client code.

(Hindi: "Factory decide kare kaunsa order banana hai — abhi ka ya scheduled")

📅 Example:

* Instant(Now)Order: Deliver now
    
* Scheduled Order: Deliver at 8 PM
    

### 📍 Strategy Pattern for Payments

> Dynamically choose payment type at runtime.

(Hindi: "User jo bhi payment choose kare — UPI, Card, ya Wallet — sab support hai!")

📲 Example:

* `UPIPaymentStrategy`
    
* `CardPaymentStrategy`
    
* `WalletPaymentStrategy`
    

## 📍 UML Diagram — From User to Delivery

> This is where we and the interviewer sit together like **partners in crime** and **think on the same page** (literally )

### Key Interfaces & Models:

```plaintext
interface Restaurant {
    List<MenuItem> getMenu();
}

interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}

class User {
    Cart cart;
    void searchRestaurant(String location);
}

class Cart {
    List<MenuItem> items;
    void addItem(MenuItem item);
    double calculateTotal();
}
```

### Singleton Managers:

```plaintext
class OrderManager {
    private static OrderManager instance = null;
    private OrderManager() {}
    public static OrderManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) instance = new OrderManager();
        return instance;
    }
}

class RestaurantTracker {
    private static RestaurantTracker instance = null;
    // similar pattern as above
}
```

## 📍Notification Service 📲

After successful order → notify via email, SMS, or push notification.

> (Hindi: "Order ke baad turant user ko khushi ki khabar milti hai!")

## 🧵 Putting It All Together — End-to-End Flow

1. **User searches 🍕**
    
2. **Selects restaurant & items 🛒**
    
3. **Adds to Cart 🧺**
    
4. **Proceeds to Checkout 💳**
    
5. **Payment using selected strategy ✅**
    
6. **Factory creates Order (Now/Schedule) 🏭**
    
7. **Singleton Manager tracks Order & Restaurant 📦**
    
8. **Notification sent ✅**

## 📍Interview Tip: UML is our Best Friend

During LLD rounds — don't rush to code.  
Draw, think, and **co-design with the interviewer**. 🤝🧠

> *"Code se zyada UML samjhaata hai!"*  
> (UML diagrams often explain more than code itself.)

🗣️ *“Interview ho ya real-life project — this LLD understanding is pure gold!”*
